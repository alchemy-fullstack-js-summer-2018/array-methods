## Dope tests

Implement functions that perform array operations similar to how they exist on the built-in JavaScript array object. Main difference is that instead of being methods on the array, they are stand-alone functions that accept an array as well as other required parameters.

Implement select array methods from scratch. Only use:
array.length (read)
array.length = x (assignment)
array[i] (read)
array[i] = value (assignment)
