Lab 2 - Array Methods
===

These are a series of rewritten array methods based on methods that already exist. The purpose behind this lab is to take advantage of test-driven development and write our own tests using Mocha.

## How to get started
1. Fork and clone this repo.
1. Create a `package.json` file by running `npm init` inside your cloned repo directory.
1. Install ESLint and Mocha as dev dependencies by running `npm i eslint mocha -D` in your working directory.
1. Run `npm start` to see the tests!
NOTE: I added Nyan Reporter to the scripts because I like it. Feel free to delete it if you don't.

Take a gander at the LAB.md for similar instructions - those are the ones I followed to set this up for myself.
